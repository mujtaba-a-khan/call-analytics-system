# UML

This page have every UML diagram I rely on when I work on call analytics. I start with the high-level actors, ddives into components and data models, and ends with workflows, AI touchpoints, and UI wiring. If someone needs to understand the system fast, this is where I point them.

## Use Case Diagram

![Use Case Diagram](diagrams/usecase.svg)

I use this view to remind myself who triggers the system. It keeps the call operators, analysts, and reporting tools front and center so I never lose track of the core outcomes we promise.

## Component Diagram

![Component Diagram](diagrams/high_level_architecture_diagram.svg)

This diagram shows how I separate the ingestion pipeline, analytics core, storage, and dashboards. When I plan a change I check the interfaces here to avoid breaking cross-component contracts.

## Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](diagrams/data_schema.svg)

These classes map to the entities I persist: calls, transcripts, metrics, aggregates. Seeing relationships and key fields on one canvas helps me shape migrations and DTOs without guesswork.

## Activity Diagram

![Activity Diagram](diagrams/activity_diagram.svg)

This flow walks me through a single call lifecycle. I follow it to confirm we capture audio, transcribe, enrich with sentiment/topics, and publish insights in the right order.

## Workflow Diagram

![Workflow Diagram](diagrams/workflow.svg)

I lean on this when I explain the wider process. It shows where automation ends and human review begins, which is critical when I sync with stakeholders.

## LLM Interface Diagram

![LLM Interface Diagram](diagrams/llm_interface.svg)

Here I track how I orchestrate prompts, guardrails, and responses. It keeps my integration with the LLM deterministic and easy to observe.

## Embeddings Diagram

![Embeddings Diagram](diagrams/embeddings.svg)

This helps me tune semantic search. It outlines where I generate vectors, store them, and execute similarity queries so I can debug relevance quickly.

## Whisper STT Diagram

![Whisper STT Diagram](diagrams/whisper_stt.svg)

I use this to follow the speech-to-text path. Each stage from audio preprocessing to decodingâ€”stays visible, which is handy when I optimize latency.

## UI Components Diagram

![UI Components Diagram](diagrams/ui_components.svg)

This layout reminds me how the client renders insight. I can see which components fetch data, which ones own state, and how we compose the view layer.
